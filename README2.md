# This file is to detail out what we learned durning the completion of this project.

The project was to build a working website to allow users to log in to their own individual profiles, create decks of flashcards, then use those flashcards to study.  Each card is cyclced through in random order.  The user can add, update, and delete the cards, or decks that belong to them.  They are also able to notate that they have previously answered the question correctly on any given card.

# Jon:

1. While I have previously used breakpoint to debug, I feel i learned a lot about it in this project because of the number of times and places I used it in order to understand what information was being passed between various methods, functions, and forms.

2. I learned a great deal about forms.  I learned when we are instanciating a form in views, and how it is used to display on the screen.  I learned about the different information that is passed by Django forms as opposed to an HTML form.  

3. I leared more about the built in random functions which allowed me to negate two functions I had previously written, clean up my code, and make in function more easily.


# JOSE :

1.Working in a group has provided me with valuable insights and skills that extend beyond individual contributions. 

2.Collaborating with diverse team members has taught me the significance of effective communication and the importance of listening to various perspectives. 

3.Also enhanced my adaptability and flexibility, as it often requires compromise and the ability to navigate differing opinions.

4. I learn about Django Forms.

5.I would like to work on giving more details to the project, when I have a little more knowledge.
